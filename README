The purpose of PicPacPut is to shrink images in bulk and then hand them
off to something else; as in a service or into a compressed file.

Example usage:

    require 'picpacput'
    p = PicPacPut.new
    p.pic
    p.pac

By the current defaults this will shrink all images to 5% and
place the images in the subfolder called resized.  Then all images
get compressed into the default resized/output.zip .  Coming soon
'put' to send the zip file where you want.

Look at the source to see the options you can define.  You have many options.
You can call the options when you first initialize the object.
PicPacPut.new( { :folder=>'./', :scale_by=>0.15, :zipFile=>'output.zip', :recursive=>false } )
